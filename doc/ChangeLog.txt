0.11 (2007-07-18) Trevor Harmon

Examples

0.10 (2007-01-07) Trevor Harmon

Stylesheets
	- The parameter (customization) system has been completely overhauled. Now, instead of supplying HR-XSL and DocBook parameters as Ant properties, you must supply them as an XSL stylesheet. This has two advantages: 1) Certain DocBook parameters that must be specified as attribute-sets (such as formal.title.properties) can now be used; and 2) parameters no longer must be specified on a single line (which became awkward when many parameters were needed).
Documentation
	- Added documentation on the new parameter system
	- Directory locations have been changed for clearer separation between single- and multi-page versions

0.9 (2006-11-16) Trevor Harmon
