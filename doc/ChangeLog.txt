	- Made parameters.xsl file name configurable in hr-xsl.xml script
	- Implemented feature request #2411472: Allow off-line work
	- Ant 1.8.0 or higher is now required to run the build script. This allows removal of the SaxonLiason hack.

0.12 (2007-10-07) Trevor Harmon
Stylesheets
	- Email in ContactInfo now uses DocBook's <email> tag instead of <ulink> for better output formatting. Thanks to Guido De Rosa for the patch!

	- Added Dutch translation. Thanks to Hilbert Schraal for the patch!
	- Fulfilled feature request #1740790: Support the LicensesAndCertifications element
Libraries
	- HR-XML 2.5 is now bundled with the HR-XSL distribution. Although this greatly increases the size of the distribution, it avoids the confusion of having two separate downloads on SourceForge, and it allows HR-XSL helper scripts to perform validation of HR-XML files.
Documentation

	- Fixed bug #1719013: Documentation for localization features is incorrect
Examples

0.11 (2007-07-18) Trevor Harmon

Examples

	- Links in the PDF output are now colorized to make their existence obvious

	Libraries
	
0.10 (2007-01-07) Trevor Harmon

Stylesheets
	- The parameter (customization) system has been completely overhauled. Now, instead of supplying HR-XSL and DocBook parameters as Ant properties, you must supply them as an XSL stylesheet. This has two advantages: 1) Certain DocBook parameters that must be specified as attribute-sets (such as formal.title.properties) can now be used; and 2) parameters no longer must be specified on a single line (which became awkward when many parameters were needed).
Documentation
	- Added documentation on the new parameter system
	- Directory locations have been changed for clearer separation between single- and multi-page versions
	
0.9.1 (2006-12-27) Trevor Harmon
Documentation
	- Cosmetic improvements

0.9 (2006-11-16) Trevor Harmon

	- Each functional work experience section is now a sub-section under a larger "Work Experience" section. This is necessary for some localizations, and it also makes functional CVs look a bit more organized. (Guido De Rosa)
Documentation
	- Explains how to choose between A4 and letter size in PDF output (Guido De Rosa)
	- Added troubleshooting chapter explaining how to handle a FOTreeBuilder error
Examples
	- Build scripts only generate output if the files are out-of-date (suggested by Guido De Rosa)
	- Demonstrations of how to choose between A4 and letter size in PDF output (Guido De Rosa)
	- There is now a "clean" target to remove generated files
